                Despite the popularity of D&D 5th edition, it seems many players are returning to older editions.<br> The recent preference in the oldschool tabletop appears to focus primarily on the 3rd and 4th<br> editions. It would appear that most players prefer the complexity of the older versions of the game<br> as opposed to the more simplistic 5th edition.

                John Johnson purchased a box of Magic the Gathering booster packs back in August of 1993 upon the<br> games release. Little did he know that fateful decision would lead to a small fortune twenty-eight years<br> later. Mr. Johnson opened most of the boosters back in 1993 but he purposfully left some unopened.<br> When he recently opened them Mr. Johnson found a Black Lotus worth upwards of $400,000.

                 Games Workshop, the company behind the largely successful tabletop game Warhammer 40k, recently<br> announced that they would be removing the Aeldari race from their army roster. This news comes as a<br> huge hit to fans who enjoyed playing their Aeldari army. Some fans have even threatened lawsuits for<br> compensation spent on the expensive Aeldari models prior to this decision by Games Workshop.
