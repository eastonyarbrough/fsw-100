            How does debugging work?
        </h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                In this example I will attempt to purposfully create a bug to show how debugging works using browser dev tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next 'div' tag is an empty header. That header should be filled with a JavaScript file. If there is no text below this then the bug has not been resolved.
